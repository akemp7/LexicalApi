# _A Word Rating API_

#### _An exercise in creating and calling an API using C#_

#### By _Anita Kemp, Loewy Malkovich, Jen Batara_

## Description

_This API is a database of words that people hate (e.g. "moist"). Users can rate these words based on a scale of 1-5 through the implementation of emojis. A 1 shows a disgusted emoji whereas a 5 shows a somewhat happier one. Users can POST new words to the API, and their ratings will be averaged with other user ratings for existing words already in the API._

## API Endpoints 
localhost:5000/api/words

## Setup/Installation Requirements
For the MVC app: 

* _Clone this repository_
* _In command line, run: "dotnet ef migrations update" in order to generate the database in MySQL_
* _Then run the following: "dotnet watch run"_
* _Navigate to localhost:5000/_

To examine the API itself: 
* _One can also navigate to Swagger at: localhost:5000/swagger to see all functionality for this API._
